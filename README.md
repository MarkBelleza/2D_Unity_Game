# 2D_Unity_Game
My first game made in Unity, written in C#.

Note: Game is still work in progress.
      Any sprites used in the game are not made by me.
      All sprites used for the game are all free assets from the unity assets store.
      Game scripts are in Warrior/Assets/Game/Scripts.

The original concept for the game is that it will be a multiplayer game where players will have to
eliminate the others either by pushing them off the map or hitting them until their health reaches 0.
The game will be fast paced in which players are able to move freely and fast hence the dash movement.
More movement features to come such as double jumps and a roll maneuver (for dodging).

As of right now I am working on creating a menu system and creating a playable demo.
